use commands following fashion - (Old ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®) - No app for both
1. Use this in one terminal "python app.py --mode receive --host 127.0.0.1 --port 65432"
2. Use this in another terminal "python app.py"
you can modify the port too

or

New Command approach - (New ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž) - app for both
1. Open terminal 1 use "python app.py" and click on recieve
2. Open terminal 2 use "python app.py" and choose file and click send
3. file is recived as recieved_file.txt and check the file
4. Can visualize using the visualize on the sender size





This is a test file for the Network-Based Data Compression Tool.

The purpose of this file is to demonstrate how data is compressed
and sent over the network to the receiver.

Once received, the data will be decompressed and should look exactly
like this original text.

This is an example of how compression can optimize data transfer efficiency
over networks, by reducing the size of transmitted data, thereby improving
network performance and reducing bandwidth usage.
